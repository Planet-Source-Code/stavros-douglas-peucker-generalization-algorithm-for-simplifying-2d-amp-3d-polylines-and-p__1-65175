### Description

The process of generalization is normally executed when the map scale has to be reduced. Another usage is in cleaning up noisy representations of polylines, possibly generated by a raster-to-vector conversion (tracing).

Generalization can be seen as a form of lossy data compression; given a large and complicated object, we seek to simplify it by reducing detail. Ideally, we obtain a polyline/polygon with far fewer vertices that looks essentially the same at a target scale. This can be a big win in computer graphics, where replacing a large model with a smaller one might have little visual impact but require significantly less storage space and rendering time.
